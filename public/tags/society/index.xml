      <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;What is social living?&#xA;Is it following what the society does? or is used to do?&#xA;How&#39;s following the &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; the safe thing to do?&#xA;Why do I think this is not something which is discussed so often?&#xA;Yet we talk about all these social networking websites and how people express themselves.&#xA;Is it really freedom of speech?&#xA;Your mom, dad, your sister, brother is on facebook.&#xA;Do you really want to tell them about your binge drinking escapade that happened last night?&#xA;How&#39;s that for social networking?&#xA;Does the word &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; intersect with the word &amp;quot;family&amp;quot;?&#xA;Don&#39;t know about a lot of history but as far I can see it seems like more its repeating itself.&#xA;The further we move away from the truth, the further we are categorized as sane.&#xA;The further we move towards the truth, we are either insane or genius.&#xA;In my opinion, thats how I would divide human beings.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>
