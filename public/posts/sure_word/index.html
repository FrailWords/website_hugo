<ol>
<li>&ldquo;completely confident that one is right&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;sure of/to do something&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;certainly (used for emphasis)&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;true beyond any doubt&rdquo;</li>
<li>used to show assent (agreement): ‘Are you serious?’ ‘Sure.’</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Not going into parts of speech, that will make things more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> &ldquo;Do you think you can do this task by tomorrow ?&quot;<br />
<strong>A:</strong> &ldquo;sure&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, by &lsquo;sure&rsquo;, the other person is saying maybe something match defintion 2 i.e. &ldquo;sure to do something&rdquo;.  Great!</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> &ldquo;Did you understand what I just explained ?&quot;<br />
<strong>A:</strong> &ldquo;sure&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, by &lsquo;sure&rsquo;, the other person is saying something similar to definition 5 i.e. showing agreement.</p>
<h3 id="example-3">Example 3</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> &ldquo;Would you be free at 10 am tomorrow for a meeting ?&rdquo;
<strong>A:</strong> &ldquo;sure&rdquo;</p>
<p>here, by &lsquo;sure&rsquo;, the other person is saying something similar to definition &hellip;..??</p>
<h3 id="example-4">Example 4</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> &ldquo;I went through your writeup, and I am not really able to understand one specific topic. Would you able to record this and send it to me by email in a video so that its easier to understand ?&quot;<br />
<strong>A:</strong> &ldquo;sure&rdquo;</p>
<p>here, by &lsquo;sure&rsquo;, the person is agreeing. ok&hellip;.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, you might ask:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;why i do hate this word when it so succintly answers every
single question we have seen yet ?&quot; and...
&quot;what would be the alternative in your opinion ?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I am glad you asked.</p>
<h2 id="revisit-examples">Revisit examples</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s revisit each of the questions and see what might an alternative way to answer them -</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> &ldquo;Do you think you can do this task by tomorrow ?&quot;<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, I&rsquo;ll most probably be done by eod tomorrow, maybe with some exceptions which I can communicate afterwards.</p>
<p>Here, the answer shows that, even though there&rsquo;s an impending deadline, the expectation is rightly set in terms of whats being agreed upon.</p>
<p>Ok, next one.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> &ldquo;Would you be free at 10 am tomorrow for a meeting ?&quot;<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yup, I am free. Whats the meeting for ?</p>
<p>Here, I am agreeing but conditionally based on what is the agenda.  Just saying &lsquo;sure&rsquo; leaves me to think - is this person really not interested/curious in what the meeting is about ?</p>
<p>next one&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> &ldquo;Did you understand what I just explained ?&quot;<br />
<strong>A:</strong> I understood most parts but x, y and z were some points that I couldn&rsquo;t grap.  Could you elaborate ?</p>
<p>Here, the answer shows that they were listening actively and have an interest in learning what was explained.</p>
<p>and last&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> &ldquo;I went through your writeup, and I am not really able to understand one specific topic. Would you able to record this and send it to me by email in a video so that its easier to understand ?&quot;<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Could you tell me which points in-specific you didn&rsquo;t understand and maybe I can improve the writeup ? I can also make a video if it&rsquo;s not clear even after that.</p>
<p>Here, the conversation revolves around improving what&rsquo;s being asked and not just blankly agreeing to whats being asked.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="can-you-cut-to-the-chase-">Can you cut to the chase ?</h2>
<p>So, by now if you were paying attention (sure?), you&rsquo;d have noticed that the answer &lsquo;sure&rsquo; leaves the world to the imagination in many cases. What does the answer &lsquo;sure&rsquo; mean ?</p>
<p>Sure (:D) it can be a very handy reply to many answers which just need that one word but in most cases, it doesn&rsquo;t convey what a <code>proper</code> answer should.</p>
<p>By <code>proper</code>, what I mean here is that the listener, or the person answering should be able to convey in their answer that -<br />
<strong>a)</strong> they were actually listening/paying attention to what&rsquo;s being asked <br />
<strong>b)</strong> its completely clear on what&rsquo;s being asked<br />
<strong>c)</strong> they do not have any follow-up questions immediately - you can always use <code>sure, but...</code> format here, but many people just leave their &lsquo;sure&rsquo;s hanging.<br />
<strong>d)</strong> they are either agreeing with your point or agreeing to do it or confident of it or &hellip;. ???<br /></p>
<p>Finally, I find this word to be almost equivalent to slamming the door on a question in the sense that the other person is not willing to even spend a few words to reply back.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So, are you sure that you still do not like the &lsquo;sure&rsquo; word ?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sure</p>
