    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> There are probably a lot of cake related metaphors in this post, you might feel like ordering one by the
end of this post, which is an unintentional side effect :)</p>
<h3 id="a-well-defined-story">A well-defined story</h3>
<p>Creating well-defined stories is an essential part of software development nowadays, specially if you are following any
of the &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; methodologies where the key motivation is to incrementally deliver value and at the same time building
towards a goal or a product release.</p>
<p>One of the main ways to define a <em>well-defined/good story</em> is through the I.N.V.E.S.T. principle -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I</strong> - independent - story should NOT be dependent on another story</li>
<li><strong>N</strong> - negotiable - scope of the story should be adjustable or negotiate how its implemented</li>
<li><strong>V</strong> - valuable - should provide business value</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> - estimable - enough clarity to be estimable</li>
<li><strong>S</strong> - small - small enough to provide quick feedback</li>
<li><strong>T</strong> - testable - independently verifiable and testable</li>
</ul>
<p>This principle is generally a guiding principle, not exactly a strict rule and, it is important that we keep this in mind
when discussing how a story is sliced/defined.</p>
<h3 id="preface---iteration-0">Preface - Iteration 0</h3>
<p>At a very abstract level, majority software product development (from scratch) starts with -</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure setup - cloud provisioning, infra-as-code &hellip;</li>
<li>Skeleton/scaffolding code setup - using best practices for the language/framework &hellip;</li>
<li>CI/CD - path-to-production - including steps like code analysis, testing, building and deployment  &hellip;</li>
<li>Observability/monitoring/alerting/logging setup &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>In brief, we are setting the foundation of the project so that it is <em>production ready</em> from day one.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve not built any <em>actual</em> software for the problem statement which <em>delivers value</em>.</p>
<p>Usually what I&rsquo;ve seen is that teams spend a lot of time refining these steps as the project goes along and with increasing
infrastructure complexity (viz. microservices, kubernetes, cross-platform apps), the effort spent in this is significant.</p>
<p>The clarity that this begs is how the <em>business value</em> is or might be perceived differently by a tech-savvy vs a non-tech-savvy
business or customer and how much are we willing to shed in terms of delivering the best-in-class software engineering.</p>
<h3 id="an-alternative-view---story-slicing">An Alternative View - Story Slicing</h3>
<p>Given that we do not want to compromise on engineering excellence and what is considered best-in-class, the question is how
these tasks are then tied into the whole &ldquo;deliver business value&rdquo; theme.</p>
<p>One way of looking at this is how we <em>slice</em> a story (the whole project/product/scope being the <em>cake</em> metaphor).</p>
<p>There are 2 ways of <em>slicing</em> a story -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>vertically - like majority of folks would normally eat a cake, by slicing vertically into individual pieces, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>horizontally - maybe not so majority who like the icing layer or the fruit only layer :D</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="right-way-to-start---vertical-or-horizontal-">Right Way To Start - Vertical or Horizontal ?</h3>
<p>In an ideal world, vertical slicing would be the <em>right</em> way to <em>slice</em> stories as they provide the complete value (think eating
all the layers of the cake together, not just a single layer of the icing). This is how we deliver <em>business value</em> at the end of
the day.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s flip the cake metaphor the other way around - do we build cakes vertically ? or horizontally ?</p>
<p>When you think of it this way, the point that becomes clear -</p>
<p><em>Enough Horizontal Layers</em> need to be built before we can start to <em>Vertically</em> start building something</p>
<p>This idea ties back to our I-0 tasks - if we try to incorporate those horizontal layers into the stories directly and try to
make it a <em>vertical slice</em>, we will end up having really large stories that incorporate too many things and violate the INVEST
principle.</p>
<h3 id="business-value---horizontal-slicing">Business Value - Horizontal Slicing</h3>
<p>But you might be thinking - doesn&rsquo;t the horizontal <em>slicing</em> also violate the INVEST principle ?</p>
<p>Delivering fast business value is the promise of Agile but if we keep building these <em>horizontal</em> layers for a long time, there
is really no actual business value in the eyes of the stakeholder who is paying for the project - all they are seeing is dashboards and
pipelines.</p>
<p>The key point that I find here is to how to show all the stakeholders - tech and non-tech - that this is actually <em>value</em>, not necessarily
something that they can see as a web page or an app feature but as a foundational step to building a production ready application.</p>
<p>To build a software system/product of good quality, the expectation needs to be set amongst all stakeholders about how long it
will take to build the <em>horizontal</em> slices and also articulate how those slices add up to form the final picture.</p>
<h3 id="trade-offs---speed-quality-scope">Trade-Offs - Speed, Quality, Scope</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s this famous saying - that you can only 2 of 3 things - speed, quality, scope - you&rsquo;ll have to trade-off on one point.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed or pace of development is usually directly constrained by the problem space - in how <em>streams</em> of work it can be parallelized
into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scope &amp; Quality - these two directly translate to <em>prioritization</em> - what&rsquo;s important <em>right now</em> and what can be done <em>later</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="increasing-detail-in-horizontal-slicing">Increasing Detail In Horizontal Slicing</h3>
<p>When we define our horizontal slices, I&rsquo;ve usually seen only <em>business stories</em> being subject to these constraints. Increasingly, I feel
that the foundational and cross-cutting stories should also be subject to these constraints of speed, quality and scope.</p>
<p>On the basis of these constraints, we should prioritize the horizontal slices in a way that aligns with how want to deliver
business value.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>There is no <em>right</em> answer here as you might expect - it&rsquo;s always a constant learning experience on how to define, scope and prioritize,
and I hope this gives the reader a new view point on how a story could be sliced.</p>
