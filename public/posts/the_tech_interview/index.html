    <p>Having gone through a recent period of job search and a sequence of interviews, I thought I&rsquo;d pen down what <em>I</em> think of the different styles of tech interviews and why I think this whole process needs a complete relook.</p>
<h2 id="personas---who-are-the-people-involved-in-the-process-">Personas - Who are the people involved in the process ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recruiter(s) (can be multiple in some cases)</li>
<li>Future Colleagues (More and less experienced)</li>
<li>Future Boss (e.g. Engineering Manager/Head Of Engineering)</li>
<li>Boss&rsquo;s boss (e.g. CTO)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rounds---how-many-rounds-of-interviews-are-we-talking-here-">Rounds - how many rounds of interviews are we talking here ?</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a typical breakdown -</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding test - take home test (multiple days) or hackerrank/leetcode (3 hours max)</li>
<li>Technical Interviews - at least 2 rounds ?</li>
<li>Culture interview</li>
<li>Interview with future boss</li>
<li>Interview with CTO/boss&rsquo;s boss (VP Engineering?)</li>
</ul>
<p>These sum up to 6 rounds - I see this as a minimum nowadays, I&rsquo;ve seen usually go more than this which I find as a complete put-off even before applying.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-interviews-trying-to-measure-">What are the interviews trying to measure ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data structures and algorithms</li>
<li>Problem Solving</li>
<li>System Design</li>
<li>Role specific characteristics - e.g. leadership, learning from failure etc..</li>
<li>Cultural &ldquo;alignment&rdquo; - belief system, values etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process needs to be repeated with every single company that you are applying to, yikes!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-giving-up-when-interviewing-for-each-company-">What are you giving up when interviewing for each company ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time - a LOT of it</li>
<li>Mental capacity/thought</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these points equate to both a monetary toll as well as a psychological/mental toll.</p>
<p>E.g. I am an introverted person and it takes a huge toll on my mental health to be talking to so many new people and trying to deliver my best over such a long process.</p>
<h2 id="mis-alignment-between-interview-and-realistic-job-scenario">Mis-alignment between interview and realistic job scenario</h2>
<p>This is the toughest cookie to swallow for me and cuts across many of the interview rounds/processes. Let me explain and I&rsquo;ll take my example.</p>
<p>I have been doing software development for around 15 years now and thats a lot of time. I have worked on lot of technologies and in teams of all kinds/sizes.</p>
<p>The position I am usually applying for is the role of a tech-lead, in a technology agnostic way and where I can find an &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; and feedback driven culture.</p>
<p>The disconnect I&rsquo;ve found in the interviews are many (I have done many of these mistakes myself but always trying to improve) -</p>
<h3 id="technology-specific-questions">Technology specific questions</h3>
<p>e.g. do I know what does &ldquo;x&rdquo; mean in a particular language ? or similar.</p>
<p><strong>What is this trying to measure ?</strong></p>
<p><em>That I actually know what &ldquo;x&rdquo; means ?</em></p>
<p><em>have I &ldquo;memorised&rdquo; this answer already ?</em></p>
<p><em>have I worked on this language ?</em></p>
<p><em>have I &ldquo;used&rdquo; this &ldquo;x&rdquo; in this language ?</em></p>
<h3 id="data-structuresalgorithms">Data structures/algorithms</h3>
<p>e.g. hackerrank, specially ones with highly uncommon data structures like graph/tree/heap etc. <em>Most</em> jobs will never ever use these data structures, only in rare cases. Add the question of &ldquo;what is the complexity of this&rdquo; and you get a package of questions that is more theoretical than practical.</p>
<p><strong>What is this trying to measure ?</strong></p>
<p><em>That I have &ldquo;used&rdquo; this data structure in a &ldquo;practical&rdquo; scenario ?</em></p>
<p><em>do I &ldquo;understand&rdquo; when this should be used ?</em></p>
<p><em>did I just practice hackerrank for past 1 month ?</em></p>
<p><em>did I memorise this &ldquo;Order of nlog(n)&rdquo; from a table ?</em></p>
<h3 id="system-design">System design</h3>
<p>e.g. design a system like WhatsApp. This question reminds me of school projects that we used to do, where there are a limited number of &ldquo;models&rdquo; that students are asked to build every year and you know exactly what shop will sell all the requirements in a box, maybe with instructions included.</p>
<p><strong>What is this trying to measure ?</strong></p>
<p><em>Have I already &ldquo;built&rdquo; a similar system and know the pros/cons in the choices ?</em></p>
<p><em>Did I just watch a youtube video that explains this answer ?</em></p>
<p><em>Did I just read a blog that explains this ?</em></p>
<p>Increasingly I find that this question needs to be broken down and made more &ldquo;specific&rdquo; in what the expectations are - this shows the interviewer has put in equal thought in why they are asking a system design question. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a very <em>lazy</em> way out in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="cultural-alignmentinterview">Cultural &ldquo;alignment&rdquo;/interview</h3>
<p>The only thing I&rsquo;d say here is that <em>words</em> and <em>actions</em> are two different things.</p>
<p>Answering culture related questions with just the &ldquo;right&rdquo; words is easy but implementing day-to-day is hard, really hard.</p>
<p>An example question is &ldquo;how do you deal with failure and given one recent example&rdquo;. This has become such a cliched question that everyone is already &ldquo;prepared&rdquo; for this. Another one is &ldquo;do you believe in inclusivity?&quot;. Who would answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; in their right minds if I wanted the job ?</p>
<p><strong>What is this trying to measure ?</strong></p>
<p><em>Have I &ldquo;prepared&rdquo; for the interview ?</em></p>
<p><em>Do I really believe in these statements I am making ?</em></p>
<p><em>Have I actually &ldquo;practiced&rdquo; what I am preaching ?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-haze-of-ill-measured-outcomes">A haze of ill-measured outcomes</h2>
<p>As you can see, each question/round leads to what I want to call &ldquo;<em>a haze of ill-measured outcomes</em>&rdquo;. This haze needs to be cleared and the outcomes made concrete.</p>
<p>Engineering as a discipline is about &ldquo;practicing&rdquo; one&rsquo;s skills and &ldquo;applying&rdquo; them at the level of one&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Measuring with clarity</em>&rdquo; needs to be a metric thats measured on the interviewer&rsquo;s side and it should be a feedback loop that continuously gets better. Strive for clarity, not perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="recruitment-ethics">Recruitment ethics</h2>
<p>Finally and not the least but probably one of the most important points - ethics.</p>
<p>I find that there&rsquo;s a level of &ldquo;mistrust&rdquo; between both the candidate as well as the companies. No one&rsquo;s to blame - its a mess thats been around for a long time and needs fixing and it starts with individual actions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t keep anyone in the dark</strong> - this goes for both the candidate and the recruiter/company - if being transparent doesn&rsquo;t get you the job, is it really worth it ? and same for company.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Over-communication is NOT a bad thing in my opinion, at least in recruitment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not leave the other person hanging on hope</strong> - goes for both sides. Communicate - its free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respect each other&rsquo;s time</strong> - just because I am searching for a job doesn&rsquo;t mean I have all the time in the world - respect each other&rsquo;s time in scheduling as well as how and when someone calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respect the individuals</strong> - be thoughtful in asking questions that might be &ldquo;personal&rdquo; in nature or not-professional - not everyone appreciates that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respect the process</strong> - be thoughtful and respectful of each other - the amount of work that both sides are putting in to make it work for everyone and this has to be visible in each communication that you make - email/call/text and also the time you send those. Do not call a person post-work-hours or on weekends unless necessary or ask for permission before doing so. Just one simple step can go a long way in building a rapport.</p>
</li>
</ul>
