    The color of beauty when its white
    A dark desire to see the light
    An inner self that is sublime
    Hews of emotion cover this time

    Helpless in my own voice
    I can only look up for hope
    A sudden reflection in the stars
    A blemish is all I want

    Settle down in this ocean of dreams
    A wonderful array of me and you
    Some unknown, some new

    I wish this could be the most perfect day
    That the world knew

    Starlight...
