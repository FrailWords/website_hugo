    Slow dance under the fading light
    Delicate balance of our imaginary flight

    Seeping through the corners are the whispers
    That echo a thousand memories

    Some that pull the moment towards infinity
    And some that make it still

    To forget the now would be a crime
    Cherish this song and all that is sublime
