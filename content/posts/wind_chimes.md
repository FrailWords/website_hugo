    A stutter in the calmness
    Of this windâ€¦ the chimes

    They dance the dance
    Shifting poses at every glance

    Echoes of textures missing a beat
    Slowly reversing as if to meet

    Tangled and colored in their rings
    Resonating like perfect beings

    A trail of distant, fading sounds
    Emerges as I follow along...
