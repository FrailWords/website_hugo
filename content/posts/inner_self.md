    Clouds across the sky are breaking up
    The calm that the empty field was holding
    The decaying noise sweeps past the shiny mirage
    Embracing the pieces of a brittle being

    Birth of this creation leads to an evolution
    A warning, a reason that came close to judgement
    One that may have lead to a closer self

    Beneath the shallow, what reveals is an unknown
    Inner insights over the fumes of cracked stones
