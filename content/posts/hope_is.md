    Hope is, what is an unknown
    Hope is, falling down the throne
    And freedom... is all I ask
    Trouble... is all that lasts

    In your heart
    In our minds
    In our secret
    Thoughts intertwine

    Colors are
    Color off
    In it's reason
    To find the cause

    Until it's you..who
    Walks the line
    Telling truth
    To stay behind

    Hope is not what I seek
    It's you who makes me weak...
    Hope is not what I desire
    Without reason we walk the fire
