    Colours… they walk by…

    On my field of hopes
    A lustrous plane of waving notes

    A slight brush of the hand
    And a million thoughts rise from the sand

    As I relive the moment that has passed many miles
    The shadows, they tangle and the songs, they fumble

    The horizon is an unknown that I wish was here and now
    Which I could take in and breathe aloud...
