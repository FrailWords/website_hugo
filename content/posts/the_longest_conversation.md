    The moment went still
    As seconds crowded the gaps
    Where every thought became a gamble
    To an analyzing mind

    Never liked this game
    Of laying bare but to no avail
    Where the past doesn't count for much
    And the future is the prize

    Turn by turn, the cloud thickens
    As conversations come and expire
    Sometimes leading to one
    And sometimes none

    Casual and light - not how I'd describe it
    What does that say if anything...

    Time was not the constraint, words were

    The last ones triggered a conclusion
    One that was inconclusive
    A gamble that was paid in a promise
    Promise of a place that is as clear as this gamble...
