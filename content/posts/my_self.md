    In the wildest dreams
    The distance isn't gone
    In my firey being
    The truth doesn't come out

    And so I lie to myself
    That what is after
    Is better than now

    Is there a day
    That makes this go away
    Of what I am afraid

    To cross the line
    To explore whats mine

    I cannot touch you
    I cannot feel you
    I cannot breath you

    Whats holding me back
    Is it me or is it my self...
