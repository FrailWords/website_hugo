    And there you stood
    The most beautiful
    Tip toeing through
    A bed of colored dreams
    
    The more it passed
    The more it enlivened
    Like the gentle kiss of the dew
    or the breeze that called for you
    
    At the end, it was more than a dream
    With open arms and open hearts
    Embracing, alive, the drizzling sky
    
    Maybe the skies were watching for us
    Maybe we were meant to be there
    So long our friends
    To a different time
    When we fall in love again
