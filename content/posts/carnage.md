    This carnage is a fear I can't let go
    Rolling down the neck, its so slow
    Vision of the horizon is pale and dry
    The closer I get, the fainter the white

    Beyond this blinding light
    There's a reality which lead to this war
    Spiritless and stateless
    Apathetic to this wide open cry

    I question humanity
    For this inadequate response
    The radiance of the wrong colors
    So much rests on the tone

    Of how we influence and act
