    waiting for love
    just something that would hurt
    and feel the feel the bubbles that burst
    would sit along and write
    see her all alive

    and I...
    loose myself inside
    come... and feel me
    breathe in...side

    whither space corner
    silence leads to rest
    up away shimmer
    stars that die in rest

    nothing is the same as you are
    left for something that
    breathes for someone else
    that soil's away in fear
    and doesn't burn in
