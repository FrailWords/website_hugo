    A day, an ending
    To seemingly go quiet
    The heart dwells in silence
    To ache upon the miles
    That we walked together
    
    Turn on the lights
    We maybe out here tonight
    To mean, to rhyme
    Maybe its you, maybe its me
    How we pretend, its a dream..
    
    How would you know
    If I was asleep
    How can I breathe
    This time...
    
    Maybe its a dream
    Maybe you are mine
    The songs ending
    Do I leave this time...
