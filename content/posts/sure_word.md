#### Context
## Some dictionary definitions
1. "completely confident that one is right"
2. "sure of/to do something"
3. "certainly (used for emphasis)"
4. "true beyond any doubt"
5. used to show assent (agreement): ‘Are you serious?’ ‘Sure.’

**NOTE:** Not going into parts of speech, that will make things more complicated.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Q:** "Do you think you can do this task by tomorrow ?"<br />
**A:** "sure"

Here, by 'sure', the other person is saying maybe something match defintion 2 i.e. "sure to do something".  Great!

### Example 2
**Q:** "Did you understand what I just explained ?"<br />
**A:** "sure"

Here, by 'sure', the other person is saying something similar to definition 5 i.e. showing agreement.

### Example 3
**Q:** "Would you be free at 10 am tomorrow for a meeting ?"
**A:** "sure"

here, by 'sure', the other person is saying something similar to definition .....??

### Example 4
**Q:** "I went through your writeup, and I am not really able to understand one specific topic. Would you able to record this and send it to me by email in a video so that its easier to understand ?"<br />
**A:** "sure"

here, by 'sure', the person is agreeing. ok....

<hr />

Now, you might ask:

    "why i do hate this word when it so succintly answers every
    single question we have seen yet ?" and...
    "what would be the alternative in your opinion ?"

I am glad you asked.

## Revisit examples

Let's revisit each of the questions and see what might an alternative way to answer them -

**Q:** "Do you think you can do this task by tomorrow ?"<br />
**A:** Yes, I'll most probably be done by eod tomorrow, maybe with some exceptions which I can communicate afterwards.

Here, the answer shows that, even though there's an impending deadline, the expectation is rightly set in terms of whats being agreed upon.

Ok, next one.

**Q:** "Would you be free at 10 am tomorrow for a meeting ?"<br />
**A:** Yup, I am free. Whats the meeting for ?

Here, I am agreeing but conditionally based on what is the agenda.  Just saying 'sure' leaves me to think - is this person really not interested/curious in what the meeting is about ?

next one...

**Q:** "Did you understand what I just explained ?"<br />
**A:** I understood most parts but x, y and z were some points that I couldn't grap.  Could you elaborate ?

Here, the answer shows that they were listening actively and have an interest in learning what was explained.

and last...

**Q:** "I went through your writeup, and I am not really able to understand one specific topic. Would you able to record this and send it to me by email in a video so that its easier to understand ?"<br />
**A:** Could you tell me which points in-specific you didn't understand and maybe I can improve the writeup ? I can also make a video if it's not clear even after that.

Here, the conversation revolves around improving what's being asked and not just blankly agreeing to whats being asked.

## Can you cut to the chase ?

So, by now if you were paying attention (sure?), you'd have noticed that the answer 'sure' leaves the world to the imagination in many cases. What does the answer 'sure' mean ?

Sure (:D) it can be a very handy reply to many answers which just need that one word but in most cases, it doesn't convey what a `proper` answer should.

By `proper`, what I mean here is that the listener, or the person answering should be able to convey in their answer that -<br />
**a)** they were actually listening/paying attention to what's being asked <br />
**b)** its completely clear on what's being asked<br />
**c)** they do not have any follow-up questions immediately - you can always use `sure, but...` format here, but many people just leave their 'sure's hanging.<br />
**d)** they are either agreeing with your point or agreeing to do it or confident of it or .... ???<br />

Finally, I find this word to be almost equivalent to slamming the door on a question in the sense that the other person is not willing to even spend a few words to reply back.

## Summary
**Q:** So, are you sure that you still do not like the 'sure' word ?<br />
**A:** Sure
