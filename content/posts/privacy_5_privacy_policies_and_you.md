#### Goal of a privacy policy
**Intended**

Protect consumer’s interests and in a digital world, their data and identity form mis-use.

**Actual**

Protect companies from consumers suing them - written by a lawyer for a lawyer.

#### Readability of a privacy policy

This [nytimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html) is the best research and visualization of how _readable_ are privacy policies of some of the services we use on a day to day basis.  For e.g. to read Facebook’s privacy policy, you need to be _college level_ educated.  To read Airbnb’s privacy policy, you need some professional training after your college degree.

This begs the question - if not every user of this service is _college_ educated or studying in a college (which is a fair assumption), then do these users know what they are agreeing to even if they read it ? Who is going to help them understand it  ?

#### Example of hidden/shadow data sorcery

Facebook and Google are the [Saruman](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Saruman)s when it comes to using this shadow sorcery.

Remember the last creepy ad you saw ? - welcome to the [party](https://neworgans.net/).

For e.g. if you are on Facebook, you could go to this [link](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen) to see which advertising companies your data is being shared with, "advertisers you’ve interacted with".

Did you really agree to share your data with these people ? Is this mentioned in the privacy policy or data policy ? Probably.  Would you understand it even if you read it ? Probably not.

Quoting this excellent [article](https://theoutline.com/post/5380/targeted-ad-creepy-surveillance-facebook-instagram-google-listening-not-alone) -

    "Not even the marketing people and data scientists completely understand 
     how the algorithmic distribution of their content works."

#### What can be done ?

We have to be optimistic towards how the privacy policies can be made more _accessible_.  For e.g. one suggestion from the nytimes article shared above is -

    "Something as simple as a list of companies that might purchase and use 
     your personal information could go a long way towards setting a new bar 
     for privacy-conscious behavior."

I, for one, have started reading the privacy policies, at least a cursory glance for super vague words which might give me an idea about weighing the use of the service vs an alternative.

    * e.g. I just analyzed [Reliance's Jio meet privacy policy](https://jiomeetpro.jio.com/privacy-policy-business) - there's a 250 word limit, so I just used the first 250 words and it comes to a score of the range that requires a _college_ level vocabulary.
