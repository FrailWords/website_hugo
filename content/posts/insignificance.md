    365, 100000, 1, 2, 18...

    10, your first pocket money
    1000, your first salary
    100000, your first saving

    24, hours it takes the earth to go around itself
    29.5, days it takes the moon to go around us
    365, days it takes for us to go around the sun

    18, years it takes for us to realize our freedom
    25, times you blink in a minute
    90, the beats per minute of your heart

    1, the first number you learn
    2, the second

    6775235741, one like you

    1, second...I am insignificant
