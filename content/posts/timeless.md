    A touch, the smell, the warmth
    the floor that never smelled better
    wiggling around to remind me of something
    so specialâ€¦

    a dinner, not the same
    not the water that rippled us together
    not the sound that woke us

    come back those moments
    the ones that felt like forever
    where we can be as wrong as we can be
    that the pale night doesn't mind so much

    timeless...
