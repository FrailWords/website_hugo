    And I saw somebody else
    In our design
    For all it means

    And I felt more than just
    In our hearts
    For all it seems

    Color me to an endless night
    Until truth comes over
    Sever broken ties
    Until the leaves blow over

    Thoughts and mind and all thats us
    Different forms of an ending
    The head rush

    Spiral down before it takes you
    Tired eyes wouldn't speak
    If at all its all true

    Color me to an endless night
    Until truth comes over
    Sever broken ties
    Until the leaves blow over
