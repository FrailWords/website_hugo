    I await the silence that fills my blood
    Knowing what to expect, fear? I bleed
    One after the other, the same thoughts
    Wish you were me, wish I were you

    I wish, I wish I could see
    The sun rise up
    The sun rise up

    Blackened by the skies above
    Reflecting on the actions that I take
    Taken Over without having a say
    In their darkness, I get lost

    I wish, I wish I could see
    The sun rise up
    The sun rise up

    My intentions are scared, my vision blurred
    The thirst within me is making me worse
    I want to stop this game, I want to feel sane

    I wish, I wish I could see
    The sun rise up
    The sun rise up

    Help me get out of this world, of the me and you
    Show me the signs which I could live through
    Let me cleanse my soul, for this is my wish

    I wish, I wish I could see
    The sun rise up
    The sun rise up...
