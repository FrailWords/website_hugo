    Repeat, repeat, the empty release
    The tangled voices that want to be free

    Repeat, repeat, what stems in me
    The higher meaning of what we could be

    Depart, descend, see the pretense
    Decay, destroy, the threads of false joy

    The construct, the being, of whats unseen
    Caged, scarred, the vision, the fallen star

    A freedom from this skin, from the alter self
    The simple, the plain, the outer crest, the inane

    Detach, defuse, the conscious, the lie
    Deeper, farther, an echoing cry

    The need to be awake, the need to separate
    The open, the free, to a higher sentient me...
