    Grains of noise reflecting from the walls
    You can hear them from afar
    Tunneling through the ambiance
    Stuttering to mask the voices...

    Voices that were heard only in whispers
    Just a little louder than the distant stars
    The ones that can't hear us

    Little pebbles soaked in yesterday's rain
    Make a bed for the faded remains
    Of the day that has just made its way
    Into the dark and the silent bay

    Solemn in my own gratitude
    As I watch her cry
    Her elegance stands tall
    Drawn in perfection and yet, still in silence
