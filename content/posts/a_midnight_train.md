    say forever say for us
    this night is all but just
    could've fallen could've gone
    a dream to which I belong

    this midnight train
    going all alone
    this midnight train
    going far alone, just

    wanna take a ride
    wanna be with me in this...
    kiss of a stranger
    just cuddle up behind

    the leaves talk in my ears
    the drops of rain that smell of your tears
    coming to the other side
    going all the way

    this midnight train
    going all alone
    this midnight train
    going far alone, just...
