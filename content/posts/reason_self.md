    Decide over me
    How far we have got to go
    Listen to the world
    How much we've got to know

    And time without a season
    And why without a reason
    They came in all the forms
    To wake us
    To know whats wrong

    Faster, arrive
    To calm the race of fire
    Decide, old enough to lie
    Fight the colors inside

    True the meaning
    True the sound
    And faultless I am raged
    The turn of the fall

    I can't erase the lie
    I can't feel the fight
