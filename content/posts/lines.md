    the path that must be
    you are one of it
    lines after lines
    step through the signs

    shivering in light
    crossing my sight
    a cry to feel a part

    don't have to do this
    we are already so apart

    what's the feeling of the rain
    washed away in pain
    what's the feeling of trying not to run
    washed away in time

    the river runs, the stars shine
    you stay where you are, is it only time
    I wonder, if I could be one of you
    get that feeling of peace that I haven't knew
