    Still on a one off
    Caught in a storm
    And I played it still
    Feel all alone

    I try to fall off
    The cold divide
    My faith is torn
    Between the lines

    And we break out
    To listen in
    And we can spread out
    To hear the spin
    Don't you know
    I am still the same
    Talk within the rhymes
    That dissipate

    Faded under the morning sun
    Too close I get to my only one
    Feel the sorrow thats come out from you
    Shatter the shadow that grown over you

    And we break out
    To listen in
    And we can spread out
    To hear the spin
    Don't you know
    I am still the same
    Talk within the rhymes
    That dissipate

    I dance today
    We dance today...
