### Preface

The Government of India has tabled a proposed bill titled `Digital Personal Data Protection` Bill or DPDP 2022 for short.

You can find the draft bill at the MeitY website - https://www.meity.gov.in/data-protection-framework.

There are really detailed explanations of the bill in its current form by newspaper `TheHindu` at -

There is enough information in these sources from eminent legal and policy scholars to suggest that this bill is legally unsound
in its terminology and how it gives the government (not the legislature or the judiciary) overarching powers and essentially a free hand
over anything in the act as it is written in its current form. I will not explain this in detail as it is already been clearly discussed in the above articles and podcasts.

### What do I want to discuss ? 

The central theme to this draft bill and most such regulation (including the European GDPR regulation) is the theme of `notice` and `consent`.

I want to delve into this seemingly simple/naive yet conniving concept.

### What is `notice` ? 

A relevant definition of "notice", as per the dictionary, says -

```text
a displayed sheet or placard giving news or information
```

When it comes to any company that collects your personal data, this `notice` can take many forms -

1. **Privacy Policies** - this is what most apps/websites show you when you sign-up for an acccount the first time. Also, they'll usually
email your registered email address whenever their policies are updated. Usually, this is a small checkbox which says "I accept....".
2. **Cookie Banners** - usually seen on websites where you get options like `accept` or `reject` or if the website designer is nice, you can probably 
choose which cookies you want to accept and which not to accept.
3. **App Permissions** - on mobile apps when you first install them, it'll say that this app will use for e.g. location, camera, microphone, wifi data etc.
and ask for your permission with an `install` button. 

### What is `consent` ?

Consent is when you take an action against a `notice`. For e.g. you click/press a button or tick a checkbox.

Think of this as you signing at the bottom of an agreement/contract that is legally enforceable.

Any such "consent" serves as a `legal basis` for the collection and processing of your data.

This is ofcourse done in accordance with the text in the privacy policy or the consent banner or the app permissions page - none of 
which you/nobody ever read.

### Isn't this a known problem ?

Yes, it is. Everyone knows that nobody reads any of this legalese that is thrown at us 
whenever we visit a website or signup for a service or install a mobile app. But still, we haven't been 
able to move past this style of notice/consent because it provides a clear/actionable way to say that 
```
Someone agree to our data practices and here's their signature.  
We are not doing anything illegal.
```

### Difference b/w something being illegal and protecting privacy ?

The key idea that these regulations (including this proposed bill) _exploit_ is that, by structuring 
the whole argument of privacy around 'if its legal, it is ok', the burden is shifted heavily towards a lay 
person.

A lay person is expected to - 
1. Read and understand the language of these complicated policies/banners/app permission notices.
2. Understand technical terms of 'cookies' or read up on it.
3. Understand how the data is shared with other 3rd parties in a complex web of data brokers and ad networks.

### Isn't anyone working towards fixing this ?

Lots of people are working on this. This includes work on - 

1. Improving the readability of the privacy policies - making them more accessible without loosing the detail.
2. Making Cookie banners more usable and easy to navigate and understand.
3. Making mobile app permissions clear and easy to understand through pictorial forms as well as 
through minimization of required permissions as and when they are needed (or not).

### India - a world within a country

Things get more complicated when you look at India's localization needs in terms of plethora of languages. We do not 
even know if there are appropriate words in all these languages to express (and with clarity) the complex language, which 
is one of the things mentioned in the proposed draft bill). Maybe there are existing solutions that can be 
used in this context but it is an additional complexity.

### Now what ? 

It's a million/billion dollar question - everyone knows/understands that providing `notice` 
is a sham and no one is going to read it (forget understanding it). This translates into a 
`consent` that was given to god knows what. 

### Theatre of Privacy

I see this a public theatre of privacy or `data protection`, where everyone is trying to save 
their backs - using a legal framework as a cover - when the whole `burden` of `choice` falls on 
the unassuming user.
