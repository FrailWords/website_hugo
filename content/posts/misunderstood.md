    To this day I have been ignorant
    And i shall be, to an end

    The deepest sadness is all I have to show for
    Not sure if its even worth sharing
    It hurts to think how we eluded each other
    Responsibilities, love, affection…

    To this day I have been alone
    And I shall be, to an end

    Never knew the right word at the right time
    Even a goodbye seemed off by a moment
    Thinking every time, those things
    They could’ve been better said

    To this day I have been confused
    And I shall be, to an end

    The myriad illusions of the world are like drugs to me
    Too much to take in yet I want more
    My mind hypnotized by all thats possible
    Attracting, not knowing whats impossible

    To this day, I have been misunderstood
    And i shall be, to an end

    I am yet to understand myself
    How I can expect you to ?
