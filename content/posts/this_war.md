    its lonely, this war
    alone I am, you are not
    fear of breaking, my heart
    long lost the feeling, I wrought

    distant dreams of pure peace
    falling down like spring leaves
    discolored they are in my colored reality
    painted red fogging the dead

    are you for real, my friend
    can you hear my soul crying from deep within
    forgive me I couldn't save it all
    for I am a broken man, crumbled I fall

    wake up to this dream of fire and smoke
    and all the words that were misspoke
    fear for your life, for its written in stone
    live for today and die alone

    my end is near, my part is over
    goodbye my friend, its all yours
    the life I have yearned for is now lost

    hope I didn't waste my last breath
    hope you'll make it count
