    There's a place we go
    Somewhere only we know
    See through the holes
    Of what we have been told

    Curtains down with you to feel me
    Close enough just to keep me breathing

    Feel the sense of desire
    Of ecstasy, of all thats higher

    Come take now what you want
    Care so much if you think I belong

    Feelings slight the water running
    Whisper sounds keeps me burning

    Now I feel it all in me
    A bang that wants to get me free
