    A split around the outside
    Is all it takes to make it go
    Like the wind, it never came
    Like the sound, it never made

    The thin voice from within
    Sanity in itself
    Thoughts of freedom and soul
    A sign of growing old?

    Its 12 here right now, 11 at some other
    Preaching the same thing
    Don't mistake me for a beggar

    A simple ask to be right
    And whats left is an after sight...
