    Find me now
    Through an empty space
    Call me now
    A different phase

    Steal the fire
    And pave the way
    My inner is cold
    For so long, I wait

    Dig me out
    The stone is born on me
    Scream and shout
    Tell the world
    What I see

    Forlorn are the dreams
    That sustain this soil
    Come by and feed
    Let it uncoil

    Don't whisper, just talk
    Into the void of between
    Closer, in and out
    To our differences
    To the life machine
