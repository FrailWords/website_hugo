    In our heart, in our minds
    In our thoughts, intertwine
    In our lies, in our hate
    In our conscience, in our fate
    Discharge the wounds that feed
    Come around to make me feel
    The Hyde once said that hurt was near
    Truth be told I couldn't hear
    There's a why, to our distance
    The ways to sound to be
    To my instincts, to my song
    To lead...
    To be told, to lie
    To behold, the why
    And all the while it just seems real
    And all that's far, that is near.
