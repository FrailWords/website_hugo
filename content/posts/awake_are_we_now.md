    Tell me the wise ways
    I could be wrong
    Stare into night space
    Follow me down

    Glimmering on the horizon
    A thousand lights
    Smoke in the air
    The roar of a flight

    Towards a dream
    Towards a try
    Is it more than me
    And you and I

    Awake are we now
    Too late are we now
    To start a new day..
