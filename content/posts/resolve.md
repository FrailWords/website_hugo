    A shudder to end the demise
    Of our long winding path

    Where the night says more than just a whisper
    Delving deeper as it sings the past

    To break the cycle
    In this trial of hope

    The footsteps slip
    In the midst, the breath slows

    Just enough to steal the moment
    And the solitary unknown

    Standing still to analyze the scene
    Tasting the rain and the has been

    Momentary lapse follows the split in the song
    In need of a resolve, I tread on...
