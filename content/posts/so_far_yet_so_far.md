    Meet me at the dawn
    To escape the silence, the wrong
    Teach me how to nurse
    So that we can both reverse
    
    On the ground, I felt the cold
    Not my feet, it was me being bold
    A forgotten glimpse of what happened
    Did I do something wrong or did I break the pattern
    
    Following the line, is not easy
    Yet the line is what saves us from feezing
    In the darkest hours, in the gaps of time
    The pleasures unbounded, so fast, we define
    
    To the beginning, and the hike
    The light, its glorious,
    We are addicted to its delights
    
    Not everyone seeks what I seek
    An itch for the dark, or maybe the bleak
    A regret of words that were let go sooner than were meant
    The more I explore, the clearer the thought of intent
    
    Circling back to the end of the day
    I have no more to say
    To the next time,
    Will I do the same ?
