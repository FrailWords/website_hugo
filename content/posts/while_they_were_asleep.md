    Turn around...I hope you do
    Listen now... I hope you do
    
    Far away...
    Its the feeling
    
    Far away...
    Can you come closer..
    To me..
    
    We surf the night
    While they were asleep...
    The blackest skies were blue
    It was just...
    Me and You...
    
    Time stood still..
    As we shed our skins
    
    Fools we are
    What good we are
    If we can't love ourselves
    
    ‘Cause how far we are
    The lights are fading out
    Can we…walk…
    Can we…talk…
    
    We surf the night
    While they were asleep...
    The blackest skies were blue
    It was just...
    Me and You...
