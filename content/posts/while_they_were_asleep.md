    Turn around...I hope you do
    Listen now... I hope you do
    
    Far away...
    Its the feeling

    Far away...
    Can you come closer..
    To me..

    We surf the night
    While they were asleep...
    The blackest skies were blue

    It was just...
    Me and You...
    
    Time stood still..
    As we shed our skins
    
    Fools we are
    What good we are
    If we can't love ourselves
    
    We surf the night
    While they were asleep...
    The blackest skies were blue
    It was just...
    Me and You...
