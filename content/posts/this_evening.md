    The sadness in me has faded tonight
    Like the light from a window of a passing train
    The drops of rain still hanging from a leaf
    A little breeze is all it takes to send shivers

    Serene or just plain, the little sounds are much to blame
    A range of emotions in a split second
    Even my heart can't guess what comes next

    Lingering on to this moment, I so want to
    Just get to know the way through

    Hanging on to this passage of time
    Trying to capture the precious dews

    So that tomorrow might be a better tomorrow...
