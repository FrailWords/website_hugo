    To cry in vain
    or do I smile in pain
    Words do not say the thought
    Thoughts do not speak out loud

    Too few are the interactions
    The trouble of unmet expectations
    Or the myriad reactions

    Sudden spike of troubled minds
    Abstract trails of past finds

    Little can I do to mince the facts
    They are there if you ask

    Tonight is heavy and I am glad it is
    At least makes me realize
    That I am still capable of loving someone else...
