    Body repels the mind
    In this fiction
    Which holds our disguise

    False pretense is the norm
    Feels like i'm against a storm

    My call for sanity is a broken dream
    The wider reality eludes the belief

    Connected spots pale themselves
    Shy for a lack of reason
    They fear the long shadow
    That has grown from within itself

    Solitary in their own remains
    Hope seems an illusion
    It drags in vain

    An answer is what will give me rest
    Connected dots to regain my inner self
