    Hero,  want me...
    Trying hard to please...
    What is that you read
    Add it towards
    The thoughts we breathe

    Come alive now...
    To know the cards
    To know the wars...

    Don't stop to color
    The mind, the calm
    How we wound

    Wait, step forward,  wait
    Delay the hours
    Delay the thought

    Truth gives up
    The truth surrounds
    A step,  a two
    We all come around...
