    Somewhere over
    In between a phase
    Up and down, saying to all
    This is how I see it

    Going sideways
    A simple motion
    The colors keep praying
    Please tell me more

    Far today, somewhere else tomorrow
    The cogs are wound too
    Breathe the silence

    The strain is same
    Its just a part of the rain
    The coldness suffers and asks
    Why me?

    Going sideways...
