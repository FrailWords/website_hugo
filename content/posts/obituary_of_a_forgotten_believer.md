    She went through the motions
    As if she were in the lap of her mother
    Drifting through time
    With the pureness of heart that none could find

    Spread across the land were her deeds
    Who will be the blessed that didn't agree
    Tired arms, tired legs, a still smile
    The long way back to the earth that she calls home

    Another day, yet not the same
    The faith nor the night could help her
    while the meek and the rotten quenched
    amid a reality that the believer in her forgot

    Many, a witness to this dark hour
    All believers, they say...
    In what? I ask...

    Another day, another night, another believer
    The pureness of the heart and belief
    What will she learn this time
    From the forgotten believer...
