    Lay across the furred land
    With glistening skies
    A million little smiles

    For now is beautiful
    A long way from
    Where you are

    Is it a fallen star
    That seems so bright
    An afterthought
    Of my life

    The echoes of thin voices
    That seem to fade
    When the lights go out...
