    Even though I try
    And tried, I must have
    Even though I lied
    And it hurt, it must have

    Towards a dream
    Towards a try
    Towards a hope
    Towards a lie

    Towards a self
    Towards a meaning
    Towards a sound
    Untoward my own

    Even though I cry
    And cried, I must have
    Distant wars I decry
    Decried, I must have

    And I couldn't even hide
    This empty pretense
    The want to give meaning
    The want to make sense
