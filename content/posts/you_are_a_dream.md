    To the hue of a vibrant roar
    To a distant desire left untold
    Hidden many are the many paths
    Where meaning finds its past

    I've fallen in love again
    To the sea of empty skies
    To the leaves that yearn the light

    'Cause you're a dream...
    That never saw time...
    'Cause you're a dream...
    That taught the night...

    'Cause you're a dream...
    That feels only mine...
    'Cause you're a dream...
    Where everything is sublime...
