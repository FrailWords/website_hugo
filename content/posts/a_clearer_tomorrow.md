    Trouble finds me in varied phase
    Not knowing the time or the place

    The two ways to a higher conscience
    Deeper and farther, towards an unending defiance

    Steps too far, towards a broken desire
    Ending in places that soon expire

    Truth deceives the meaning of conception
    A flowing reality of myriad reflections

    Reaching for the unknown and the final
    A day, a night, the constant fight
    Seeming to hide the melody that calls me

    Resolve, alight...
    Hear the call to follow the light...
