    Tonight I walk away
    From what.. you might ask..
    From what.. I ask...

    Tonight I felt sorrow
    From what.. you might ask..
    From what.. I ask...

    Tonight.. the time.. it looks at me...
    Like what.. you might ask..
    Like what.. you might ask..

    Keep... moving...
    The lights...
    Will never die upon you...
    Like i'd never walk away...

    Keep... moving...
    The night...
    Will never die upon you...
    Like i'd never look the same...

    Tonight... I am sad...
    From what.. you might ask..

    Do you see at last...
