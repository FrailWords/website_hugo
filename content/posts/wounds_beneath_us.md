    Am I too weak to walk
    Or stone deaf to all the talk
    Trudging along towards infinity
    Scarlet rays light up our eternity

    To walk amongst the grieved
    You felt... you were alive
    The day was towards an end
    An end...to a great ire

    The wounds are beneath us
    The wounds are alive
    The past can't be relived
    We still want to try

    Tired are these eyes
    The burnt souls that washed them dry
    The dusk is painted red
    A kiss of the sky that cries of dread
