    Is it love, is it anger
    is it fright, is it madness
    Is it me or is it you
    Is it a moment or an eternal awe

    A mirror says a lot
    but what if it is a lie?
    Am I being fooled, or so I may think

    I am anxious, I am a mere human
    Embarrassed I stay low
    My eyes bear witness to my soul

    Brutal and bare, relations and feelings
    the invisible thread, the stare of a loved one

    hold onto to your seats
    the show has just begun
