    Broken glass has to break more
    To make way for the new
    The cracle doesn't seem enough
    The pieces, they are few

    Blowing low doesn't make it a fact
    Seeing reality is one
    Coming to grips with certainty
    The ceiling is too far to touch

    Reality - its as broken dream
    Too much to take in, I've never seen
    Beauty and awe and colors that blind you
    Of facts that make you find you

    A lover, a friend can help you find that
    A good disguise to the chaos
    Thats keeping you alive...
