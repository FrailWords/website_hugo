    hear me now, its said and done
    
    no argument, no false promises
    
    whatever was asked, its been given
    
    no fake words, its all so real
    
    in these times what I feel like
    
    never was, never been, never felt
    
    it took time for this to come
    
    the sweat is gone but I am still here
    
    too much to wait for something so simple
    
    can't it be a little easier
    
    to get what you wanted, to get what i need
    
    its another day, another time...
