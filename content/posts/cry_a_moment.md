    So long its been since we've talked
    about war and peace and all that is past
    you can feel the rain and the wind
    its not the same anymore

    people have wept for no reason
    with no consolation in sight
    far away we are from each other
    we still share some pride

    war is not a solution, its a way
    believing in it leads us astray
    no one remembers the fallen
    innocent lives soon forgotten

    cry a moment,
    cry a moment for respect,
    cry a moment for peace,
    cry for yourself...

    remove that blindfold we've been burdened with
    choose to see what is real and what is not
    one moment at a time, one voice at a time
