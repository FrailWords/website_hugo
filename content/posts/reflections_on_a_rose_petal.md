    A week after his father died, he didn't call me
    I could understand the reason why
    Heard about it from another friend
    It was an attack, he said

    Life's fragile moments, I thought to myself
    He was like me but what did he feel
    Dissonant but arpeggiated at the same time?

    At school, he used to talk to his pillow
    We used to joke about it
    Would the pillow be a gentle friend to him?
    Tell him about the stars and distant life

    as they danced to the quiet pale night
    the smell of jasmine, the sounds of crickets

    All this, I wondered, as the roses finally arrived

    What he would see in them
    That covered his father's body at the last rites
    The dead ones, the free ones and ones
    which need to breathe out

    And then, The silence...
    Of glistening memories,
    Of trust and dreams,
    Of all that had passed and what has to...
