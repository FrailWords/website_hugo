    Caught in the waves of time
    Just another start...
    Hiding in, in these words of mine
    To a different self...

    Colors color the night
    Beauty ain't always bright
    The distance of our horizons
    The fall in our vices

    Hiding in, in the center of the world
    Hiding in, in the center of the world...

    While I dream our dreams, inside our walls...
    The touch..., the breath..., the smell...
    Is that all I long for...

    Hiding in, in the center of the world
    Hiding in, in the center of the world...
