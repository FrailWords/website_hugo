    Freedom is not what you are
    or not what you'll ever be
    Its not what you can see or feel
    or the tears that you ever gave away

    Go on, touch that leaf
    The color in it will change
    Wander around, do something
    Jump up, go round in circles

    Smile at whats in front of you
    no, seriously…
    Give the best of what you are
    to whats in front of you…

    Freedom, do you get it now?
    Break a leg, say hi!
    Smile a bunch and feel the smile!
