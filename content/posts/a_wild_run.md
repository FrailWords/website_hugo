    Drowning, hear me fall
    Starting, to feel the draw
    Waiting, a call that never was
    Dreaming, to a joyful...

    What surrounds is all too numb
    A touch, a scream, a voice
    Quietly dumb

    Deafening, being, solemnly sane
    Am I what you wanted
    Am I wanted too

    A low rise is all I could ever make
    Carefully studying a different take
    Truth be told I am ok
    With how life has turned
    Into this wild run

    Deafening, being, solemnly sane
    I am wanted...
    But by who...
