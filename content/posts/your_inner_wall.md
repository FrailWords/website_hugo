    All the cobwebs are lying at the scene
    Circling to a higher conscious, scream
    Watering them down and down it must be
    To a low, to the light
    To the fore, to the fight

    Don't ask the weight to fall
    Don't mind the mob, the call
    Here in the lights of certainty
    Lies the hole that hides endlessly

    Don't fall away this time
    Trust all the way in mine
    Fear all thats inside
    The tide is turning now

    A duty to calm the war
    To know its gone too far
    Overwhelming the thoughts
    The colors are caught

    In my scream, in my thoughts
    The watershed, the mirror
    Who'll protect your wall
    Who will start the war
