    A little over
    The far fades
    Can't catch the wind
    Its over me

    The rails are scarred
    With the youth of mine
    I fear its falling in
    As I witness the lines

    Too late, the call
    Threading closer...
    I am in a fall

    Leaning on a ghost
    With a naked breath
    Beyond the fall of light
    An illusion is all thats left

    Color me beautiful
    As I scatter
    Into this void of reason
    And the vague after
