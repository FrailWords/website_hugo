    And somewhere she's around
    Comes calling the sound
    Forget the breeze, the lights
    The threads that fill the space

    Colors are winding her shadow
    To the beat of a blink
    A silhouette of fascinating life
    One step at a time into the light

    Straight lines seem to have vanished
    As have the shapes
    All in a pastel mirage
    I see the most beautiful face...
