    Would you last if I didn't stay

    To realize whats beyond the farthest lights
    Sparkling in the dying moments

    The breeze warm enough to dry the sand
    Embracing the souls that pass by

    In a wall of noise and a thousand dreams
    To the un-relished anger that came before the realization

    Rewind the tape to understand the path
    That leads to the lonely door

    At last the calling was heard
    That opened the mind to a new rehearsal

    Where its us again and no one else...
