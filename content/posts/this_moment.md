    How wild... this all...
    In strange lives that we make
    How high... would it end...
    In a leafless path, never seems to end

    Cold eyes... can see through
    The trials of many, the faults of few
    To this day, to our today
    Could it be, would it all be ok

    What I ask is not strange
    What I feel is not inane
    What I fear is not a blur
    The still, the moment, for what its worth...
