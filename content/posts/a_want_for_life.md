    Sail away in two face
    Color me as free race
    And couldn't be so far
    This sanity I preach
    Closer than I thought
    The light of ones that fought

    Just feel me see her eyes
    Constantly changing surprise
    A whole that figures
    Of all you see
    And all you want

    Purity in parts
    Of a little life that I sought...
