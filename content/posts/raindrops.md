    Death is what awaits us all
    Forgive them for what you believe
    Soon it'll be over, seasons change
    Your time will come to bleed again

    You're falling down, falling down on me
    Frail and pure you cleanse my soul
    Without fear you lend your life
    In the sweetest moments of your cry

    Passion and anger are your ways
    Emotions run dry on your wet face
    I could see my reflection in you
    A relationship I have with a few

    Drip, Drip, Dripping till your last breath
    From the edge of a window, you hang to death
    Be brave now, for tomorrow is another day
    Starting a new life, wish I could say
