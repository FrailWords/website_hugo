### What is a cookie ?

Pieces of data that a website uses to 'remember' your activity so that it provide 'better' services.

### Types of cookies

First party - basically from the website you are visiting.

Third party - from other websites (not from the current domain/website).  E.g. Google Adsense, Analytics, Facebook Like Button.

The most common use of third-party cookies is to track users who click on advertisements and associate them with the referring domain.

### How do I view the cookies already stored in my browser ?

https://www.wikihow.com/View-Cookies - this site explains how to view and selectively delete cookies.

### Is my browser accepting 3rd party cookies ?

https://www.whatismybrowser.com/ - this site detects the current browser settings - including your ISP(Internet Service Provider), your location (city), if Javascript is enabled or not, if 3rd party cookies are enabled or not.

### Disable 3rd party cookies

Ideally, you should disable 3rd party cookies -

Disabling any sort of cookie "may" lead to some "degradation" in how you experience a website.

**NOTE**: Safari, Firefox and Edge block 3rd party cookies by default on their latest versions.

### Incognito mode/Private browsing

Google's explanation of what's collected in Incognito mode - https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7440301.

Basically, you are not hiding from your ISP or from the website - you are just not saving it in your local history.

Google's incognito mode is doing its best to give intuitive controls to block 3rd party cookies - [Chrome Privacy Blog](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/more-intuitive-privacy-and-security-controls-chrome/)

### Tools I use on my browser to protect my data

* Browser - BRAVE - https://brave.com/ - its based on chrome, works like a charm, comes with the best privacy settings by default and is intiutive and takes up much less CPU and memory as compared to Chrome/Edge.  Available on Android and iOS as well.

* Search Engine - DuckDuckGo - https://duckduckgo.com/ - search results are not as good as Google but whenever you want to use Google, go into Incognito/private mode.  Use this as a default - works for most normal cases.

* Browser extensions -

    * HTTPS Everywhere (You don't need this if you are using BRAVE) - force all links on a website to be HTTPS - this should be mandatory - any company thats not communicating on HTTPS is simply lazy.

    * Privacy Badger (You don't need this if you are using BRAVE) - blocks all tracking/analytics scripts

    * uBlock Origin - open-source ad/malware/tracker blocker - allows much more fine grained control over what's blocked
