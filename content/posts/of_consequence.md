    Down with the sunrise
    The music, it fades away
    Drowning in the busy lights
    Am I alone in this fray

    Every step, a bit too far
    Every thought, a bit too sour

    Nearer to the horizon
    Than the shadow would say
    Too far, too long
    Am I about to break

    As I watch back
    Its all a blur
    Due drops on the teary eye
    A haze of violent incurrence

    Of consequence, only a few to please
    The pieces I kept collecting
    Towards a higher reality and an unending cease
    Only to know that they never fit together
