    Soften the touch that makes the sound
    Feel the water in around
    Shimmering reflections in hindsight
    Cruising slowly in the moonlight

    A crest, a trough and then again one
    It feels me slightly, feels just a little dry
    Feels just a little happy, just a little sad

    The view across is all you
    Spanning the mirrors in all hues
    An escape, a walk that'll make you free
    A silence that will be serene

    The blend of elements so warm and quite
    Colors, the chaos all in spite
    Take me in, to your deepest desires
    A liquid dream and I conspire
