    Roar the silence
    Cut the bullshit
    I know you
    shut this bit

    Let me solo
    don't break it
    cover up your face
    be blessed with

    My time, My place
    My words its rage

    caught up in this reality
    let me call my inner god
    searing I am at such apathy
    the cold river turns colder

    Heap the grudge till its over you
    smell the sludge of the ego
    its foul..

    I say, keep it straight
    don't mind
    lies are a thousand
    do not kill this time
