    An enemy of far out reach
    Bells of fire that ring of screech
    Colder vicinity shares the warmth
    Of bitter duality, of silent songs

    Filling this void with drops of noise
    The between and the lost voice
    Light filtered through the slits
    A pattern that surprisingly fits

    How can I share this surprise
    These faded moments that come to uprise
    Lowering my stance to a naked inception
    Where lone and few are the needs for deception

    Slow sounds echo this stance
    Peculiar and still familiar at a glance
    The writings, the scatter, the abstract
    Still slumbering down a familiar track
