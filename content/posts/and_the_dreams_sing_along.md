    Together we are afraid
    Of what has it come down to

    A silence, a lonely place
    The fear of a sound that begins to erase
    The kindness of an open heart...
    A beginning that went too haste

    Delayed are our lines that start and end
    The words that never meant to pretend
    They spread like the wildfire
    Without a vessel, they expire

    Does it make the world a better place
    To know that it was not right
    Does it hear the cries
    To give it meaning, to transpire

    An open heart wouldn't take this on
    A distant thought which follows along
    The chance of being at one
    A chance of making the dream sing along...
