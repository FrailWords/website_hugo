    We walk around
    Enough to hide the pain

    In truth we abound
    For the meaning of same

    The telling way to our desires
    Fewer mutating thoughts that rise to aspire

    Into a fiction that is yet to be born
    A dream to understand the gone

    What begins now is a new wave
    Defiant, wiser, transient in thought

    Gently pushing the walls
    So that I can breathe
