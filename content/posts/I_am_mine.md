    just after the other day
    my gaze fell upon this fray
    it was in me I realized
    trying to make me ionize

    the calm night, the magic light
    those pale eyes staring at such a sight
    my every spine stretched to its finality
    is this your reality?

    I am mine, I am a star
    selfless but selfish
    crying but not happy
    my broken thoughts stand in line
    the wind weeping in my senses

    today's all i've got you know
    my eyes want to speak to me
    why won't you let it go?
    why won't you let it be?
